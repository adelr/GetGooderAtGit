# GetGooderAtGit - Experimenting with Git/GitHub :exploding_head:
Use this repository to practice with Git.

## The prerequisites (see [link to instructions](https://github.com/TNMDCollaborationWeek/TNMDCollaborationWeek)) below for more details):
  1. [Install Git on your computer](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and make sure you can launch Git bash.
  1. Watch [Learn Git in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE).
  1. **Optional:** install the free [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
  
**Note:** Git bash (command line interface) is recommended rather than the Git GUI (Graphical User Interface).

## The plan:
  1. Git (version control on your local computer) :confused:
  1. GitHub (version control in the cloud via the web interface) :astonished:
  1. Git+GitHub (combining the two) :scream:

# Challenge

## :octocat: Theme 1 - What is GitHub?   
There are different code repositories but what sets GitHub apart is its usage in the open source software development world i.e. the data wrangling R package [`dplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) is hosted on GitHub. 

Create a resource containing information about different public GitHub initiatives created by international statistical or machine learning research organisations. Present your repostiory to address the following questions:  

+ How are statistical or ML research organisations using public GitHub repositories?     
+ Are there guidelines for how GitHub is used by these organisations?
